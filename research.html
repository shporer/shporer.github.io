                Discovering small planets around small stars<br>
              </font></i>The TESS version of the well known "M-dwarf
            opportunity" takes advantage of the small size and
            (typically) high proper motion of M-dwarf transiting planet
            candidates host stars, in order to rule out each of the
            several false positive scenarios, thereby showing that the
            only viable scenario is a transiting planet orbiting the
            target star. This approach does not use high precision
            radial velocities (RVs), which in most of the relevant cases
            is not attainable due to the system's small RV amplitude.
            This technique enables the discovery of small, terrestrial
            planets around nearby stars, thereby helping to put the
            solar system terrestrial planets in exoplanet context. <br>
            This work has led to the discovery of several small,

            Primary collaborator: Ian Wong.<br>
            Space-based transit surveys (CoRoT, Kepler, K2, TESS) are
            routinely providing visible-light continuous long baseline
            high-precision time series photometry for a large number of
            stars. This high quality data has enabled astrophysical
            studies not possible before, including the study the minute
            photometric variability following the orbital motion in
            stellar binaries and star-planet systems. The orbital
            modulations are induced by a combination of gravitational
            and atmospheric processes, including the beaming effect,
            tidal ellipsoidal distortion, reflected light, and thermal
            emission. Therefore, the phase curve shape contains
            information about the companion's mass and atmospheric
            characteristics, making phase curves a useful astrophysical
            tool. I have reviewed this subfield in <a

          <p><i><font color="#3288a8"> The Warm Jupiters project -
                Studying the inflated gas giant exoplanet conundrum</font></i><i><font
                color="#3288a8"><br>
              </font></i>Many of the short period gas giant exoplanets
            (aka hot Jupiters) have radii larger than theoretically
            expected. Although several explanations have been proposed
            none have completely solved this puzzle. One clue to
            understanding gas giant inflation is the empirical
            correlation between planet radius and stellar irradiation at
            the planet's orbit. While it is consistent with inflation
            due to increased stellar irradiation it does not identify
            the exact mechanism, and, correlation does not necessarily
            mean causation. That correlation is shown as a solid red
            line in the plot below, showing planet radius as a function
            of stellar irradiation for gas giants with a well measured
            radius and mass. The plot shows that due to low number
            statistics it is not clear how low in planet radius and
            irradiation the correlation continues and whether there are
            indeed no inflated gas giant below a certain irradiation
            level.<br>
            We have set out to detect transiting gas giants with an
            irradiation below about 10<sup>8</sup> erg s<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>,
            which we refer to as Warm Jupiters. <b>The primary goal</b>
            is to better characterize the radius-irradiation
            correlation.<br>
            <b>A second goal </b>is to study orbital migration by
            measuring the orbital eccentricity of warm Jupiters. Due to
            their wider orbits warm Jupiters are not expected to be
            tidally circularized, hence their eccentricity distribution
            is a fingerprint of orbital migration processes. <br>
            <b>A third goal</b> is to detect gas giants with lower
            equilibrium temperatures, for atmospheric studies, and with
            a weaker tidal interaction with the host star, for stellar
            obliquity studies. <br>
            The transiting Warm Jupiter candidates for this project are

            Mullally. <br>
            Heartbeat stars are an emerging class of eccentric binary
            stars with close periastron passages. The characteristic
            heartbeat signal evident in their light curves is produced
            by a combination of tidal distortion, reflection, and
            Doppler boosting near orbital periastron. Many heartbeat
            stars continue to oscillate after periastron and along the
            entire orbit, indicative of the tidal excitation of
            oscillation modes within one or both stars. These systems
            are among the most eccentric binaries known, and they
            constitute an exciting opportunity to observe tidal effects

            of <i>Kepler</i> heartbeat stars using Keck/HIRES, in order
            to measure the orbit and characterize the two stars. Our
            sample currently includes over 30 systems, which is the
            largest sample of these unique systems where the orbit was
            measured with radial velocities. Our goal is to understand
            the formation and evolution of heartbeat stars, and to use
            them to study the processes of tidal dissipation and orbital
            migration. The physics learned from them will apply to many
            other astrophysical systems, such as high-eccentricity
            planet migration and eccentricity-induced mergers in triple
            systems.<br>

            Primary collaborators: Tomer Holczer, Tsevi Mazeh <br>
            Some transiting planets discovered by the <i>Kepler</i>
            mission display transit timing variations (TTVs) induced by
            stellar spots that rotate on the visible hemisphere of their
            parent stars. An induced TTV can be observed when a planet
            crosses a spot and modifies the shape of the transit light
            curve, even if the time resolution of the data does not
            allow the detection of the crossing event itself. Our new
            approach can, in some cases, use the derived TTVs of a
            planet to distinguish between a prograde and<br>
            &nbsp;a retrograde planetary motion with respect to the
            stellar rotation. Assuming a single spot darker than the
            stellar disk, spot crossing by the planet can induce
            measured positive (negative) TTV, if the crossing occurs in
            the first (second) half of the transit. On the other hand,
            the motion of the spot toward (away from) the center of the
            stellar visible disk causes the stellar brightness to
            decrease (increase). Therefore, for a planet with prograde
            motion, the induced TTV is positive when the local slope of
            the stellar flux at the time of transit is negative, and
            vice versa. Thus, we can expect to observe a negative
            (positive) correlation bet<img alt="KOI 203"

            prograde (retrograde) motion. Detecting this correlation in
            <i>Kepler</i> transiting systems allows to distinguish
            between prograde and retrograde planetary motions, and a
            similar approach can be applied to eclipsing binaries. The
            figure on the left shows an example of a the detection of a
            negative correlation between TTV and local slope, for
            Kepler-17b. This suggests the system is in a prograde
            motion, as already identified in Desert et al. (2011, ApJS,
            197, 14). <br>

            <li>In this work we sought out to study hot Jupiter
              atmospheres through their <i>Kepler</i> (i.e. optical)
              phase curves. However, typically when a phase curve signal
              is identified it is a super position of several processes,
              including not only atmospheric processes (reflected light
              and thermal emission) but also gravitational processes
              like the beaming effect and tidal ellipsoidal distortion.
              Therefore, interpreting the <i>Kepler</i> phase curve
              requires simultaneous modeling of all processes which may
              introduce degeneracies. Therefore we studied 3 phase
              curves that show only an atmospheric signal while the
              gravitational processes are negligible. We model 2 of
              those light curves in this work (Kepler-12b and
              Kepler-41b), shown in the figure below, and a 3rd phase
              curve (Kepler-7b) was analyzed elsewhere. Somewhat
              surprisingly all 3 phase curves show a maximum at a later
              phase than the secondary eclipse phase. We interpret this
              as resulting from an asymmetric brightness distribution,
              in the optical, of the planets' atmosphere where the
              brightest region is shifted west of the substellar point.
              This is consistent with results based on IR phase curves
              of other systems. Since these 3 phase curves are the only
              ones where the atmospheric component is seen directly
              (without the gravitational signal) and they all show an
              asymmetric atmospheric brightness distribution, it
              suggests that a similar asymmetry exists in many other hot
              Jupiter atmospheres as well. We discuss the possible
              implications of such asymmetry.</li>

                out to characterize it in more detail, especially its
                atmosphere. We measured the secondary eclipse in several
                different wavelengths: optical (<i>Kepler</i>), near-IR

                day-side, confirming the expected high day-side
                temperature and identifying a high albedo. The host star
                has a visual binary companion 1.2 arcsec away, so they
                are fully blended in all our photometric data sets. We
                obtained a Keck/HIRES spectrum of each of the two stars
                and derived the flux ratio as a function of wavelength,
                which we then integrated to get the dilution factor for
                each of our data sets. The improved host star parameters
                we derived from the spectrum made it smaller and cooler
                than previously thought. This in turn led to a smaller
                planet radius based on the measured transit depth. This
                work also included an analysis of the <i>Kepler</i>
                full orbital phase curve, deriving a night-side
                brightness temperature and a refined planet mass through
                the beaming effect and the tidal ellipsoidal distortion
                of the host star. We also noticed that the secondary
                eclipse time is 34.6 ± 6.9 seconds earlier than expected
                based on the mid transit time and light-travel time
                across the orbit. All data included in this work is

            (aka Doppler boosting) is a minute effect that causes the

            effect to the stellar rotation during eclipses. As the
            eclipsing object crosses over the disk of the eclipsed star
            it blocks regions with different radial velocity, so due to
            the beaming effect it induces a photometric signal that is
            superimposed on the eclipse light curve. This signal is the
            photometric analog of the spectroscopic Rossiter-McLaughlin
            (RM) effect, and is sensitive to the sky-projected angle
            between the eclipsed star spin and the orbital angular
            momentum, commonly referred to as the spin-orbit angle. The

            a minute effect that causes the observed flux of an object
            in a binary system to modulate following its radial velocity
            (RV) modulation. The photometric amplitude is linear in K/c,
            the RV amplitude divided by the velocity of light. Such
            small amplitude is usually too small to be measured with
            ground-based facilities. Although, similarly to many other
            physical processes, the beaming effect becomes much larger
            in a system composed of two compact objects. Here I measured
            the beaming effect using the <a href="http://lcogt.net">LCOGT</a>

            Other processes that might induce photometric modulations
            along the orbital motion (tidal ellipsoidal distortion,
            reflected light, heating) have a negligible amplitude in
            this system. This was one of the first measurements of this

              <b>Shporer</b> et al. 2010, ApJ, 722, 880</a><br>
            HD80606b is a unique transiting gas-giant as it has a 111
            day eccentric orbit (<i>e</i> = 0.93). Observing a complete
            transit is challenging since it is rare due to the long
            period and it is 12 hours long so it cannot be observed from
            a single ground-based site. We carried out a multisite
            campaign including 10 observatories and 13 telescopes to
            observe two transits in 2009 and 2010. The phase folded
            transit light curve using all 13 data sets is shown below,
            where data sets are color codes according to the filter
            used. The fitted model for each filter is overplotted by a
            solid line and residuals are shown at the bottom with error
            bars. In this work I developed a method to combine partial
            transit light curves (some of them with no out-of-transit
            data), showing how coordinated multisite observations can
            result in high-quality transit light curves.<br>

            light curves from immediately after the discovery of
            transits (5 new + 1 already published), spanning one month.
            The figure on the right shows the 6 data sets (blue)

            refined the system parameters and constrained any variation
            in the transit parameters (midtransit time and impact
            parameter) with time. The constraints on the impact
            parameter variation were consistent with a long-term
